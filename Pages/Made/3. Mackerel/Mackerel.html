            A watercolour painting of a mackerel I did for my Grandma. I really like mackerel. My Grandma bought me some smoked mackerel from a fancy shop not that long before I painted this.
            <br>I was going through a bit of a fish phase when I made this. I was watching a Channel 4 series from 2015 called <em>The Catch</em>, about the worklives of British fishermen. 
            <br>I eat quite a lot of tinned mackerel.
            <br>This was my first attempt at a watercolour for a very long time. I was pleased with how it came out, particularly colour wise. I added to it gradually over the course of a week, and I finished up with some vibrant and layered blues.
