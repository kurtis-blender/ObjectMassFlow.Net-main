        <p class="description">
            An image of a Jester, cut out from red and black paper. Made for the exhibition evening we did in our house named <em>Here Are Our Berries</em> on the 17th February 2024.
            I wanted to challenge myself to create a character with just two bold colours. I like how Jock-like his outfit is, he was meant to be juggling but I forgot to add the balls.
            <br>I like his expression also. Originally he was going to have a big cheesy smile, but I realised last minute that I would prefer if he had a serious look to him.
            <br>The written title at the bottom is my first attempt at Carolingian Miniscule, a calligraphy script used in the Holy Roman Empire between 800 and 1200 AD.
