        This is a collection of objects, bits and bobs, thingies, doohickies, that I placed on a table in my bedroom during an event me and my housemates put on. It was called <em>'Here Are Our Berries'</em>, and it took place in February.
        <br>To a degree, this is a culmination of a type of assemblage I've been doing since early 2023. I called them 'Pockets', and I would post them to my Instagram story. They were flatlays of little objects I would find on the floor. 
        <br>Below are some examples of these. The Full Pocket was much larger. I took these choice specimens from the plastic case I've collected them all in.
        <br>I like these things because in many cases it's difficult to ascertain what they do. They each have a certain shape or texture that makes them distinctive. The challenge is finding unique ones. When put next to each other they feel a little like every type of thing and nothing also.
