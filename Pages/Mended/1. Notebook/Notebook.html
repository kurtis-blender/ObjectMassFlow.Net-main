        <mark class="highlight">Fixing:</mark> Spread some PVA glue over the paper spine and the binding, then rigged it up into this clamping situation that took me way too long. 
        There's a piece of plywood on each end keeping the spine pressed against the binding, and another notebook in between with it to help the blue one stay in place. 
        Ideally I would've just used two clamps. I only have one, and it wasn't long enough anyway. 
        So I tied a ribbon and some string over and across the two blocks, then slid a piece of bamboo so that I could twist the ribbon tighter. 
        I put the bamboo into the vice on my desk, tied the ends of the ribbon to the bamboo so it wouldn't unwind and voila: I'm the first person to perform <em>Shibari</em> on a notebook.

    <p class="fixed">
        <mark class="highlight">Fixed:</mark> The paper spine bonded really nicely back onto the page bindings. 
        Only flaw is the top of the second contents page stuck to the first one, due to slightly overzealous gluing. 
        But this is no problem, now the notebook opens naturally to the first page, which is quite nice perhaps.
        Hopefully this fix will help protect the threads holding together the page bindings, I was a little concerned that they were going to get more worn and break without being covered.
