We’re building something together, in this house. We’ve come together here, as friends, not as an organisation. Old friends, to be sure. Emerging from before the turn of the century. Historical transition was clear and inevitable to us from the beginning. 
<br><br>
We work from within our world. We know we have not escaped it, in this house. But it provides a platform from which one can observe, and rid ourselves from what has gone. 
<br><br>
We are oriented around experiences, ones we share commonly and hope to share more commonly still. We share love and knowledge. We hope for beauty and curse at its absence. 
<br><br>
We live freely, we are doing good because we know we are doing good. In all manners, we are liberal. In the correct structure, that which aligns with the self will maintain the whole. 
<br><br>
We see things primarily as they could be, or as they might be, if viewed from our perspective, because we are not overly attached to how they are.
<br><br>
This is because we feel, if everyone was to see things our way, people would enjoy themselves more, and so things would be better. Lifestyle as revolution, informality as comfort, pacifism and leisure. 
<br><br>
In this house we meet to practice our philosophies. We see, make, and discuss beautiful things. Between our persons, constructed bonds can be extrapolated to be larger - providing the bond remains strong. Collectivised innocence shares the burden of lightness. 
<br><br>
That said, we do not advocate our structure. It must be found for his or her own. Our politics are deduced and refined through it, but just as our politics go beyond our structure, our structure is not our politics. They are associations. What happened inside is unique to us, insular to the group, the result of a lifestyle and as a result untranslatable.
<br><br>
I am Leonard Woolf. I often think of the world. I promote others to think and act on it also. The degree to which I am successful cannot be determined. But in this house in Rodmell I feel I am right, we are right and new, if not successful. Effective in reshaping ideas of the world, and so altering it from within our position.
