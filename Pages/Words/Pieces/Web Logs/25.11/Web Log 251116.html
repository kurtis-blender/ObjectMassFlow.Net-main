    <p class="poem">
        I take my phone, my love, from out my hole,
<br>Betwixt my cheeks do I store it, so safe. 
<br>These eyes, near closed, try read the screen, like mole
<br>I love you phone, please care for me, your waif.
<br>With you I could never be bored, for sure
<br>To hold, to kiss, to lick, to tap, all day
<br>You stay with me, pocket bound evermore
<br>Mine own, my phone, without compare, for play
<br>You take me in to your wide web, endless
<br>Phone world is where I wish to stay, secure
<br>My mind at rest, tucked up inside your nest
<br>The outside world, when I compare , so poor
<br>I love you dear, I must be near my phone
<br>You open up a world for us, alone

        <strong>Web Log Audit #1 </strong>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph2">
        I think it would be a helpful process to perform a monthly audit of the the WebLogs. A little catch up over a cup of tea, to see what’s been going on. Collect the ducks, place them in a row. Say ‘hmmmm, what kind of ducks do we have here? A mallard and an alabio, how interesting...’
<br>To see, mainly, what kind of connections can be made between the pieces of writing, so they are less discrete but rather working together as the beginnings of a wider body of work.
<br><br>
There were 4 pieces from the last batch (not including the wee poem posted with this audit):
<br>1. Participating in Material Culture, an essay about material culture and it’s political utility as a term
<br>2. Wise Guys at the Docks, fiction about a ex-dock worker explaining containerisation to two Mafia thugs
<br>3. Boots, an essay about Vimes boots theory, and the affordability of craft goods
<br>4. Gnome Autofiction, fiction about a life as a plastic gnome in a garden
<br><br>
<br>These are a set of writings about, firstly, Objects. Initially, as a totality, the entire gamut of human-made stuff. Then, through the history of globalised trade that expanded with the invention of the multimodal container. Thirdly, a soft economic assessment of a theory of the ratio of cost to durability of consumer objects. Finally, imagining a life from the perspective of an object.
<br>The politics of objects, then the infrastructure of objects, then the economics of objects, then the ontology and semiotics of objects.
<br>I will often be writing about objects in the WebLogs. Stuff is what interests me most.
<br><br>
These are also about cultures of objects. Firstly, defining the term that describes analysing matter through culture, and culture through matter. Then, about two subcultures and labour organisations (dockworkers and Mafia members) and their relationships to objects. Then, the beliefs we hold on the value of possessions, and what we are willing to pay for them, which are cultural considerations, not just economic. Finally, the Gnome as a cultural archetype is something I have been fixated on for a little while (primarily because of its relation to time and labour), but in this story I look at it through its lens as an object, and how that materiality might inform the Gnome as a mythological figure.
<br><br>
The world is so full of stuff. That means that there are an infinite combination of objects to analyse through a large number of interesting lens’. Infinity x large = A large infinity. But this is a good start, beginning with some of the lens’ that are most interesting to me: politics, infrastructures, economics, and semiotics. Perhaps further variations on these themes to come, or perhaps different topics and themes, we shall see.
