        <img src="Jester 8.png" alt="The final print is wonky, missing the feet, and a lot of detail in the centre of the chest" class="image8">

            <h1 class="title">Jester Stamp</h1>
            <p class="description">I found a small metal stamp in a box full of stamps in a scrap store near Leeds. 
                I bought two, including this one of a Jester. 
                These are my first attempts at printing with it, using red ink. 
            <br>
                I find Jesters to be interesting characters. It is funny that they are allowed to pull off the kinds of charades that would lead to swift death for others, that power allows itself to be poked
