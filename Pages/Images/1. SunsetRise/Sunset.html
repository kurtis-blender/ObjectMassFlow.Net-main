A change from one colour to another presents as a crack in the atmosphere. The sun could be an exposion. The horizon line is sharp and dead straight, and the sea is black, rippled with deep blues." class="image1">
        
        <img src="Sunset 2.png" alt="Almost the exact same image, but on this one I added a slight ripple effect. The sharp lines between colours become blurred, and the forms leave little to focus on. The horizon line is still as sharp though." class="image2">

        This sun is rising or falling, and it's doing so with some real vigour. The sky is very red. The sea is very blue. The sun is very hot.
