               <br>What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming</em>

            This image is a map of the marine traffic around the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which spans the Patapsco River in Chesapeake Bay, outside the city of Baltimore.
            <br>On March 26th 2024, the 300m long container ship MV <em>Dali</em> collided with the bridge, after experiencing electrical failures, causing the bridge to collapse. 6 people were killed, including Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandoval, 38, who was the youngest of eight siblings from Azacualpa, a rural mountainous area in northwestern Honduras along the border with Guatemala.<a target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-bridge-collapse-honduras-mexico-guatamala-victims-ac79dd7413b948c635549ef1845c6d22"><sup>1</sup></a>

            <br>Economic losses from the ports closure have been estimated at $15 million per day.<a target="_blank" href="https://thedailyrecord.com/2024/03/26/bridge-collapse-likely-to-have-profound-impact-on-port-of-baltimore-operations/"><sup>2</sup></a>
            <br>The state of Maryland plans to rebuild the bridge in 4 years, at a cost of between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion.<a target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/baltimore-bridge-collapse-body-found-cdd8441c5dff48028d1e141b943ca31e"><sup>3</sup></a>
