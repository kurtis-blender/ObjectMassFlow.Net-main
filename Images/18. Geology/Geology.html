        <p class="writing">Lots of things have happened. Lots of things are going to happen. Somewhere, in between those two lines that stretch out in their respective directions, an event occurred. That event could only be titled accurately as: ‘Teaching German Children about Geology’. One of the objects that was created and used during that event was a big wall hanging. I think you’re meant to write the answers in chalk into the boxes.
            <br><br>
            After a further series of events subsequent to that, or at least subsequent to its production, this wall hanging found itself in Nunhead, at the top of Vesta Road just off the roundabout. It was there that I found it. That was probably two years ago. The hanging string had come off at one end.
            <br><br>
            I recently hung it for the first time at the exhibition called ‘Torpor’ that me and my housemates put on at home. To do this I had to epoxy glue the broken string back on, and drill two holes into the brickwork of my rented bedroom to put wall plugs and long screws into. Now it hangs.
            <br><br>
            I’m glad it hangs. It calms me down. It’s quite visually appealing, which helps. I like that it’s trying to teach me something, even if I can’t understand very much German. Most crucially, it’s always nice to think about time as a monumental, inexhaustible body or substance, rather than a series of sequential moments. Fourthly, it’s all blue on the other side, which looks nice too.
            <br><br>
            We’re currently in the ‘Erdneuzeit’, or Cenozoic geological era. ‘It is characterized by the dominance of mammals, insects, birds and angiosperms’ says Wikipedia. That’s good to know. Those are some of my favourite sorts. </p>
